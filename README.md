# Introducing Samurai DEX

Samurai warriors remain symbols of **discipline**, **courage** and **honor**. And in tribute to these great Japanese fighters... I named my decentralized exchange in their name.

With **Samurai DEX**, users can swap, earn, vote using this platform.
The protocol facilitiates automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I built the frontend with the use of...

* Solidity
* React
* Web3.js
* Tailwind CSS

And on the backend and database, I used some protocols that I've never use in the past like

* Sanity (Web3 headless CMS, used for storing users and transactions) 
* Alchemy (a dev tool to debug and ship products faster, used also to connect to Reinkeby testnet)


Here's a preview of what I did with [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/).

Using Sanity's API key, I listed the wallet address, user name (if there was any), and transactions conducted by that specific user.
The tool is useful since it has Real-time editing and available API requests. It is best in assembling infrastructure from the best components.

> **Disclaimer**
> This repo is for demonstration purposes only. It is not yet complete and there's still need to add features like adding cryptocurrencies aside from ETH. 
> Managing token lists could also be added on this.

> Feel free to contribute by adding functions to Swap, Pool, Vote, etc.

In summary, this will be a good beginning tool for any  dev to work with in building their own version of a DEX.
